RespondLC is using [Companion](http://www.companionapp.io/) to provide a digital presence that helps community members stay safe. Companion is a mobile application for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/companion-never-walk-alone/id925211972?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.companionapp.companion&hl=en) that shares your route with friends as you travel from one location to another. When you start a trip, you add friends from your contacts list, who then confirm that they will keep track of you. Your location is shared with them throughout the trip, and you can easily notify all of your companions if you're feeling nervous. Companion has other great features that you can read about on [their website](http://www.companionapp.io/).

RespondLC has established a network of trusted students to serve as companions for the Lewis & Clark community. To use Companion, simply download the app and request the list of companions by contacting RespondLC at the number below.
