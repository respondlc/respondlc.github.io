Lewis & Clark College students formed RespondLC on Saturday, November 21st. We are working in conjunction with [barryglassdoor](http://barryglassdoor.com) to provide services to the community that will help students stay safe and connected.

##Buddy System

RespondLC created a hotline that any community member can use to request a buddy via phone call or text message. When we receive a call or message, we forward it to a selected subset of our buddy list, who responds and helps. We want to ensure that students and members of the Lewis & Clark community feel on and off campus.

We have had more than 500 people from the LC community sign up after making the buddy sign-up page available last week.

##Companion

RespondLC is using [Companion](http://www.companionapp.io/) to provide a digital presence that helps community members stay safe. Companion is a mobile application for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/companion-never-walk-alone/id925211972?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.companionapp.companion&hl=en) that shares your route with friends as you travel from one location to another. When you start a trip, you add friends from your contacts list, who then confirm that they will keep track of you. Your location is shared with them throughout the trip, and you can easily notify all of your companions if you're feeling nervous. Companion has other great features that you can read about on [their website](http://www.companionapp.io/).

RespondLC has established a network of trusted students to serve as companions for the Lewis & Clark community. To use Companion, simply download the app and request the list of companions by contacting RespondLC at the number below.
