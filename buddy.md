##[Request A Buddy](https://docs.google.com/a/lclark.edu/document/d/1QeuKK73K5aTsM7ItEXJn9_mwAkRs_Pcv7YCWKVQqTvQ)

In the space of a few days RespondLC has created a system that allows any Lewis & Clark community member to easily ask for a person to keep them comfortable and feeling safe. We have a simple hotline that students can call or text that forwards directly to a network of trusted volunteers. Our goal is to ensure that members of the Lewis & Clark community feel safe on and off campus.

###If you are a Lewis & Clark student you can access the phone number to request a buddy [here](https://docs.google.com/a/lclark.edu/document/d/1QeuKK73K5aTsM7ItEXJn9_mwAkRs_Pcv7YCWKVQqTvQ).
